# MQTT

The plugin can publish the status of the NAS to an MQTT broker, for displays and Home Assistant. It is off by default. Switch it on in the MQTT card on the Settings page; a save restarts the publisher. While the broker cannot be reached, the card shows the reason from the log. The settings are the keys below in `fan.cfg`, which can also be edited by hand, then `ugreen-nas-ctl mqtt-stop` and `mqtt-start`.

The publisher is `ugreen-nas-fan publish` (`backend/internal/mqtt`, a small hand-written MQTT 3.1.1 client, no dependency). It only reads, the way the status page does, and never writes a fan register. It runs apart from the fan daemon, so it also runs where fan control is off. `ugreen-nas-ctl start` and `stop` start and stop it with the daemon; `mqtt-start`, `mqtt-stop` and `mqtt-status` handle it alone. Pid file `/var/run/ugreen-nas-control-mqtt.pid`, log `/var/log/ugreen-nas-control-mqtt.log` (replaced on every start).

## Settings

In `/boot/config/plugins/ugreen-nas-control/fan.cfg`. The keys work in a v1 and a v2 file; the plugin never rewrites the file on its own.

`updates` reads what Unraid wrote itself: the fresh `.plg` copies in `/tmp/plugins`, the container status in `/var/lib/docker/unraid-update-status.json` and the OS check in `/tmp/unraidcheck/result.json`. It checks and downloads nothing.

Alarms carry a `code` (`cpu_hot`, `cpu_unreadable`, `disk_hot`, `nvme_hot`, `fan_stalled`) for a display to translate. They use the limits the fan daemon uses, so they also show while the daemon is not running.

## Connection

MQTT 3.1.1, clean session, keep-alive 30 s, reconnect after 1 s up to every 60 s. Commands are subscribed at QoS 1.

- A refused connection is logged with the broker's reason (protocol version, client identifier, server unavailable, user name or password, not authorized).
- A subscription the broker refuses (SUBACK failure, for example by its access rules) is logged; commands then never arrive.
- Client ID, user name and will topic must be valid UTF-8 without NUL, each string at most 65535 bytes; otherwise the plugin logs the error and does not connect.
- A packet the broker may not send (reserved or client-only types, a second CONNACK, a malformed PUBLISH, a topic with wildcards, QoS 3) closes the connection, and the plugin reconnects. PINGRESP, SUBACK, PUBACK and QoS 1 and 2 PUBLISH are handled.

## Commands

A fixed list, nothing else is run:

| `cmd`      | Needs                     | Runs                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `reboot`   | `mqtt_control`            | `powerdown -r`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `shutdown` | `mqtt_control`            | `powerdown`                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `update`   | `mqtt_control_updates`    | `plugin update <file>`, `target` `plugin` and `name` from `updates`                                                                                                                        |
| `update`   | `mqtt_control_containers` | `update_container <name>` for each container created from the image, `target` `container` and `name` from `updates`; `target` `containers` (no `name`) updates every container on the list |

```json
{ "cmd": "update", "target": "plugin", "name": "ugreen-nas-control", "ts": 1767000000, "nonce": "a1b2c3" }
```

The first `cmd_result` is `started` or the reason for a refusal. While a command runs, more answers follow: one per step (`step`, `total`, `name`, text `running`, or `failed: ...`) and a last one with `done` set (`done`, or `N of M failed`). A container is found with `docker ps`; the image from `updates` and the one `docker ps` shows are compared with `:latest`, `docker.io/` and `library/` made equal.

A command is refused when:

- `ts` is more than 30 s from the NAS clock, or `nonce` is missing, longer than 64 characters or already used by an accepted command in the last minute (at most 256 are remembered);
- another command was accepted less than 10 s before;
- the previous command has not finished (one program at a time, each ends after 30 minutes at the latest);
- the plugin or container is not on the `updates` list, or no container was created from the image. Unraid itself is refused.

The program starts after `cmd_result` is sent. Give the broker a user that may write `cmd` only where you want it, and keep the broker on your LAN.
