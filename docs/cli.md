# Command line

All Go code is one binary, `ugreen-nas`, that runs as the tool its name says (multicall). The archive holds it once and the tool names as symbolic links. `ugreen-nas <tool> ...` works too (`ugreen-nas led-ctl status`).

Run them as root on the NAS.

## ugreen-nas-fan

Talks to the fan chip, runs the curves every 2 s, reads sensors. Subcommands: `info`, `hardware`, `conflicts`, `cs201x`, `probe`, `probe-fans` (`run`, `status`, `confirm`, `forget`, `restore`, `tachs`, `regs`), `backlight`, `power-on-ac`, `status`, `history`, `set`, `calibrate`, `restore`, `daemon`, `publish` (the MQTT publisher) and `mqtt-test` (one test connection, settings as JSON on stdin; [mqtt.md](mqtt.md)). Background: [fan.md](fan.md), [conflicts.md](conflicts.md), [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

```
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ugreen-nas-control/backend/ugreen-nas-fan status
```

`status` prints sensors, chip state, presets and the daemon's state file (`/var/run/ugreen-nas-control.json`). `watchdog` is the petter's last state: `state` is `off`, `armed`, `action_needed`, `yielded` (IT8613E: the `it87_wdt` module is loaded, nothing is accessed) or `not_counting` (IT8613E: the value is non-zero but stands still, nothing is written); `counter` is the timer value read back (IT8613E: the 16-bit value register). See [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

`power-on-ac` reads, `power-on-ac set on|off|last` writes what the NAS does when AC power returns (JSON); from a value it cannot decode (IT8613E, older BIOS) it needs `--force`. Only this command ever touches it: not `status`, the daemon, `restore` or the probe. A write refuses while a fan rival runs. Models, registers and caveats: [power-on-ac.md](power-on-ac.md).

`cs201x` (DXP2800 GT only):

- no argument: reads chip id, 16-bit revision, host interface state, fans, temperatures (cpu = NTC2, board = NTC4, unsigned), the temperature input registers and the watchdog registers (counter read twice, 1.5 s apart). Writes only the Super-I/O unlock and device select.
- `confirm [fan1] [fan3]`: switches fan control on for the named fans (default both; fan1 = cpu, fan3 = case) by saving `fan_map.json` (`chip: CS201x`). Refused while the host interface is off, or when a fan reads 0 rpm or more than 30000. Reads only; the host interface is never switched on.
- `forget`: removes the map; fan control is off again.

Without the map the daemon does not start on this model.

## ugreen-nas-ctl

- `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`: the fan daemon (pid file, error log).
- `mqtt-start`, `mqtt-stop`, `mqtt-status`: the MQTT publisher.
- `led-status`, `led-enable`, `led-disable`, `led-import`, `led-boot`, `led-stop`: the LED switch ([led.md](led.md)).
- `report`: anonymised JSON for a model report (below).
- `diag`: one anonymised, read-only diagnostics block for a bug report ([Diagnostics](#diagnostics)); `diag --full-scan` also scans the display buses.
- `event stopping`: called by the Unraid event script at shutdown.

```
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ugreen-nas-control/backend/ugreen-nas-ctl status
```

## ugreen-nas panel

Front-panel buttons and beeper, from UGREEN's driver facts. `buttons` prints how well the model is known: `confirmed by users, #165` or `vendor source, not yet confirmed` (the registry's `panel` check, [panel.md](panel.md)).

- `buttons [--watch]`: power and reset button state; `--watch` prints press and release events. Read only.
- `beep [--freq Hz] [--ms N]`: one tone, 20 to 2000 ms; the speaker is always switched off afterwards.
- `power-action [--dry-run]`: the watcher of the opt-in shutdown on a held power button; `--dry-run` only prints `would shut down now` ([panel.md](panel.md#shut-down-on-a-held-power-button)).

## Support requests

Paste the output of [`diag`](#diagnostics), plus the NAS model and what you expected. It replaces the `status` commands and every other command we used to ask for.

## Diagnostics

Run it as root on the Unraid box and paste the whole output into the bug report or the forum thread:

```
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ugreen-nas-control/backend/ugreen-nas-ctl diag
```

The output is Markdown: a header (versions, kernel, model, BIOS), a _Checks_ list with one line per problem found (a rival fan or LED tool that is running comes first as `CONFLICT: ...`), then collapsed sections. Every section has its own time limit; a section that fails prints its error and the rest continues.

Collected: DMI model strings, the report summary, LED state (settings, per-LED state, bay to SATA port to slot name, an I2C scan of all buses, the I2C and SMBus controllers (PCI class 0c80 and 0c05: address, ids, bound driver, the /dev/i2c adapters under it), ACPI devices with an `HT32` HID (path, status, the PCI controller behind it) and whether the DesignWare I2C modules exist for the running kernel and are loaded, the network LED state (operstate, carrier and bond or bridge members of the LED network device, whether a default route exists without printing the gateway, and the verdict the LED daemon stored: `network_ok` and `network_reason` in `ugreen-led-ctl status`), the CS201x registers on the DXP2800 GT, `ugreen-led-ctl status`), fan state (chip, speeds, source temperatures, failsafe, watchdog, fan caps and map, calibration, tach inputs), other fan and LED tools (installed, running with pid and uptime, cron entries and User Scripts that write fans or LEDs, kernel modules, hwmon outputs in manual mode, whether the plugin yields), drives by slot name (type, spin state, temperature), a _Features_ block (one line per feature: state and effective settings, `n/a for this model` where the model lacks it), every known setting of `fan.cfg` and `leds.cfg` with its value, plugin state (installed files and the cached archives against the flash `.plg`, flagged as `update pending a reboot or reinstall` when they differ; the plugin cron file and the age of `/etc/cron.d/*ugreen*`; the plugin install, start and stop lines of the last 24 h, at most 40; the update channel as `official`, `official next` or `other (host only)`), the raw power and reset pad words of the front panel, the PCI chain of each NVMe drive (BDFs only, root port first), loaded modules, hwmon entries, I/O port ranges, PCI IDs of SMBus, storage and network controllers, matching `dmesg` lines and the last 50 `ugreen-*` syslog lines. The LED status, the per-LED output and the I2C adapter names pass the same filter as the log lines.

Never collected: serial numbers, UUIDs, asset tags, MAC and IP addresses, the host name, drive serials, ids, models and labels, pool, share and user names, MQTT host, user, password and topics. The `pluginURL` of a fork carries a GitHub user name, so only its kind is printed. Addresses, the host name, `serial=`/`user=`/`share=` values, `/mnt` paths and serial-looking tokens in log lines are cut out of the whole text. Settings: the keys are the ones the code reads (`fan.KnownSetting`, `ledctl.KnownKey`, `mqtt.Keys`, the UI keys), per-bay and per-LED keys included, and they print with their value. Hidden: unknown keys (`<key>: <hidden>`), credentials and addresses (any key containing `pass`, `token`, `secret`, `user` or `host`, the MQTT name), the excluded drives, drive serials (`bayN_serial`, `smart_ack_*`) and the names behind script and network inputs (only the kind prints; scripts show as a count with the interpreter of their shebang). Hidden known keys print `<hidden> (set)` or `(empty)`. Read the output before you paste it.

The _Features_ block has one line per feature, `<id>: state and effective values`; a feature the model does not have reads `n/a for this model`. The ids: `led.control`, `led.daemon`, `led.live`, `led.status_mode`, `led.disk_activity`, `led.smart`, `led.disk_errors`, `led.standby`, `led.netdev`, `led.night`, `led.alerts`, `led.sync`, `led.shutdown`, `led.effects`, `led.identify`, `led.import`, `fan.control`, `fan.daemon`, `fan.mode`, `fan.curves`, `fan.inputs`, `fan.excluded_drives`, `fan.limits`, `fan.failsafe`, `fan.quiet`, `fan.jobs`, `fan.shaping`, `fan.calibration`, `fan.history`, `fan.map`, `fan.profiles`, `fan.scripts`, `watchdog`, `power_on_ac`, `panel.buttons`, `panel.beeper`, `lcd.backlight`, `mqtt`, `conflicts`, `ui.dashboard`, `ui.language_theme`. A new feature gets its line in `featureTable` (`backend/internal/nasctl/diag_features.go`), its id in `documentedFeatures` (`diag_test.go`, which fails until both exist) and its id here.

The _Model_ section compares what was detected with the model registry (`web/models/`): per area the registry state and what is still open, and expected against detected for bays, M.2 slots, LAN ports, fan chip and headers, LED controller and watchdog; a difference shows in _Checks_ as `MISMATCH`. The last block is the same result as JSON (`"schema": "diag/1"`) and can be attached as evidence for a model; the visual checks (Identify blinks the right bay, the case view matches) still come from the Feedback page.

`diag` runs its independent reads side by side (at most 6 at once, the output order is fixed): the fan and LED probes together, then the LED, fan, PCI, dmesg and file sections. The I2C tools of the LED section stay one after the other, so no bus sees two transactions at once, and the fan and LED tools keep taking the hardware lock for each access. `UNC_DIAG_TIMING=1 ugreen-nas-ctl diag` prints the run time of every section and tool call to stderr (profiling; off by default).

In the text mode `diag` prints two progress lines to stderr (`diag: collecting, this takes up to a minute (I2C scan)...` at the start, `diag: done in N s` at the end), because the report only appears when every section is read; stdout is the report alone, so a redirect or pipe is unchanged. `--json` prints no progress.

The I2C scan (`ugreen-led-i2c scan all`) lists every `/dev/i2c-N`, SMBus (I801) first, then DesignWare, then the rest, and prints one line per bus as soon as it is done. Graphics buses are not scanned: adapters named `i915 gmbus …`, `AUX …`, `AMDGPU DM …`, `AMDGPU i2c …`, `Radeon i2c …` or `nvkm-…` (DisplayPort AUX channels and display DDC of i915, xe, amdgpu, radeon and nouveau; names from the kernel source). No UGREEN device sits there, UGREEN's own driver skips every adapter not named `SMBus` or `Synopsys`, and a boot-time scan of 14 such buses took more than 30 s. Each one stays in the output as `/dev/i2c-3 (i915 gmbus dpc): skipped, display bus …`. An adapter with an unknown name is scanned. `ugreen-led-i2c scan all --include-display` and `diag --full-scan` scan the display buses too (30 s limit, as before). If the scan still times out, `diag` prints the buses finished so far and lists the ones it did not reach.

No hardware writes: no LED, fan, EC or Super-I/O register is written. The pad words are read through `/dev/mem` opened read-only (`0xFFFFFFFF` means the box does not answer there); the network block reads sysfs and `/proc/net/route` and sends nothing, the LED daemon's own probe supplies the ping verdict. The only system change is `modprobe i2c-dev` when the module is missing, because the I2C scan needs `/dev/i2c-*`; the tools it runs keep their own lock and cache files as in normal use. The output says so (`loaded i2c-dev for the scan`). The temperature line shows `acpi zone` apart from `board`, marked unreliable. When the LED probe fails and an I2C controller has no driver bound or an `HT32` ACPI device exists, _Checks_ adds one line saying the LED controller probably sits behind that controller. The new reads only list sysfs and `/proc/modules`; nothing is loaded or sent on any bus. `diag` does not load `i2c_i801`: without the SMBus adapter it skips `ugreen-led-ctl status` and says why.

### Feedback JSON

`ugreen-nas-ctl diag --json` runs the same diagnosis and prints one JSON line (`"schema":"feedback/1"`) for the plugin's Feedback page:

- `model`: `id`, `name`, `known` (in the registry); `versions`: `plugin`, `unraid`, `kernel`.
- `summary`: one paragraph of at most 600 bytes, built from the checks: the ids that are `MISMATCH`, `ok` and not compared, the fan chip, the LED probe with address and LED count, and the I2C controllers without a driver (LPSS I2C and SMBus functions only; the SPI flash controller and other class 0c80 functions are listed as "other serial bus" and left out). A new check shows up in it by itself.
- `checks`: `area`, `id`, `expected`, `detected`, `ok` per check of the `diag/1` evidence; `ok` is `null` where nothing can be compared.
- `diag_markdown`: the text `diag` prints. `took_ms`: run time.

Everything goes through the same scrubbing as the Markdown (no serials, addresses, host names or drive names).

The page reaches it through `api.php`, which runs as root like the rest of the Unraid web UI:

- `POST diag_start` starts the command in the background, one run at a time, and answers `{"ok":true,"job":"<16 hex>"}` (the running job if there is one; `409` with the command's message when it is refused at once).
- `GET diag_status&job=<id>` answers `{"ok":true,"state":"running","elapsed_ms":…}`, then `{"ok":true,"state":"done","result":{…}}` or `{"ok":true,"state":"error","error":"…"}`. The result is handed over once. A malformed id is `400`; an unknown or expired id is state `error`.
- The files live in `/var/run/ugreen-nas-control-diag` (tmpfs, mode 0700), never on the flash. A job is deleted after delivery, after 10 minutes, and stopped after 5 minutes.

## Report a model

Run the report on the Unraid box and paste the JSON into the [model report form](https://github.com/ugreen-nas-control/ugreen-nas-control/issues/new?template=model-report.yml):

```
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ugreen-nas-control/backend/ugreen-nas-ctl report
```

It prints the DMI product name, the chips found, the bus probe, the LED and fan self-test results and the plugin version as JSON, without serial numbers, IP addresses or drive names. Then say in the form what works on your device. Without a shell, use the plugin's **Feedback** page: answer per capability, collect the data (scrubbed: no serial numbers, IP or MAC addresses, host or drive names), and one click copies it and opens the prepared issue; paste it into the _Device data_ field. **Report a problem** on the same page opens the bug form with the same data. The two forms are generated from the model registry (`just docs`). Check with _Identify_ on the LEDs page that the right bay blinks.

A report turns an _expected_ capability into _community_ ([how verification works](hardware.md#how-verification-works)). To add the model yourself: [development.md](development.md#add-a-model).
